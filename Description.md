## Development Challenges

1. **Model Optimization**
   - Initial ONNX conversion required careful handling of dynamic axes
   - Memory management during inference needed optimization
   - Balancing between model size and inference speed

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Ensuring consistent audio format handling
   - Managing temporary file cleanup
   - Validating audio duration and sampling rate efficiently

3. **Container Security**
   - Balancing minimal image size with required dependencies
   - Managing permissions for non-root user
   - Securing model file access

## Unimplemented Components

1. **Streaming Audio Support**
   - Current implementation limited to file uploads
   - Streaming would require significant architectural changes
   - Real-time processing needs additional optimization

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Current design focuses on single file processing
   - Batch processing would need queue management
   - Memory constraints with multiple simultaneous requests

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Streaming Implementation**
   - Implement WebSocket support for real-time audio
   - Add chunking mechanism for long audio files
   - Optimize buffer management for streaming

2. **Batch Processing Enhancement**
   - Implement message queue system (e.g., Redis)
   - Add background worker processes
   - Implement progress tracking

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement model quantization
   - Add caching layer for frequent requests
   - Optimize audio preprocessing pipeline

## Known Limitations

1. **Audio Constraints**
   - Limited to 5-10 second WAV files
   - Fixed 16kHz sampling rate requirement
   - Single channel (mono) audio only

2. **Resource Requirements**
   - NVIDIA GPU recommended for optimal performance
   - Model loads entirely into memory
   - Initial startup time for model loading

3. **Scalability**
   - Single instance deployment
   - No built-in load balancing
   - Memory usage scales with concurrent requests

## Assumptions

1. **Deployment Environment**
   - CUDA-capable environment available
   - Sufficient system memory (minimum 8GB)
   - Stable network connection for model download

2. **Usage Patterns**
   - Low to medium concurrent request volume
   - Clean audio input (minimal noise)
   - Hindi language audio only

3. **Security**
   - Deployment behind API gateway/reverse proxy
   - Network security handled by infrastructure
   - No sensitive data in audio content
